# Excel

While I've got plenty of experience with pivot table and index/matches, I'd rather demo a cool trick that I haven't seen anyone else use but is suprisingly useful. 
If you want text within a pivot table (provided it's added as a connection), you can add a measure as text concationation to achieve the desired result.
