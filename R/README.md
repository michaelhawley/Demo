# R Demo - COVID19

Here I'm having a play around with freely available Coronavirus data. 
Coronavirus numbers are sourced from another Git account which updates daily.  New data is saved to a backup folder. 

## Number of cases v deaths

I take away two things from this graph.  First is that the number of cases has grown **really** fast. The GIF is hardly moving until it is. 
The second is, that there must be a lot of uncertainty about how many cases there are and how may deaths. The fatality rate seems to vary wildly by country which suggests that either something to do with the country is impacting the rate of survival, or that misreporting is going on. 

NYT did a great piece on the the discrepancy between the increase in the background death rate, and the reported deaths from COVID19, suggesting that many are dieing from COVID19 without being listed as so.

It's also very probable that there's a large degree of undertesting which is skewing the mortality rate. 
It is clear that deaths lag cases, so potentially with more time and more data the countries shown converge to a similar mortality rate.

## Worst hit

I've broken up the US, Canada, Australia and China into states/provinces to allow for more comparible analysis. 
Potentially this is unfair.  The US seems to take up most of the top spots in this graph.
