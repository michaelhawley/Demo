# Demo of SQL, R, & Python 
Here's a demo of some basic scripts written during lockdown.

## R - COVID19
I used R extensively during Universtiy and for ad-hoc pieces of work over the last few years.
Here I'm taking some free COVID19 datasets and begining to put some graphs to them
Still a work in progress that I'm going to continue to add to. 

## SQL - COVID19
I've only used basic SQL; mostly to *'bridge the gap'* within other applications or as SQLite within python. 
*Lockdown 2020* is a great time to transfer that knowledge to **PostgreSQL** and consolidate that knowledge. 

**SQL_PrepareData** Pulls in data and transforms it
  *N.B.* you will have to change the directory
   **SQL_Analysis** Answers some basic data questions

## Python - QV Webscrape
While I've used python to make small games in the past, I've mostly used it for scraping data.
I've often found it a great way to make a quick data-set when required. 
  **QV Scrape** shows how easy it is to scape data from websites. I choose to pull in QV data as it's a great example of how to cycle through pages, grabbing data.
