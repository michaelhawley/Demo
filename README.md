# Demo of SQL, R, & Python 
I making this demo during the great 2020 lockdown. My partner and I recently left our jobs with the intention of doing a US Roadtrip.  COVID19 put a stop to that! 
Who needs a holiday when you can practice programming? So far I have three small demos that will hopefully show I have some some (limited) ability to write code for the purposes of analysis. 

## Summary
**R Demo:** I used R extensively during uni but only occasionally since.  Now seems like a good time to practice visualisatons. 
**Python:** I've found python a great tool for collecting datasets. I've added a quick example here. 
**SQL Demo:** I've only used basic SQL; mostly to *'bridge the gap'* within other applications or as SQLite within python. 
*Lockdown 2020* is a great time to transfer that knowledge to **PostgreSQL** and consolidate that knowledge. 

## R - COVID19
I used R extensively during University and for ad-hoc pieces of work over the last few years.
Here I'm taking some free COVID19 datasets and begining to put some graphs to them
Still a work in progress that I'm going to continue to add to. 

## SQL - COVID19


**SQL_PrepareData** Pulls in data and transforms it
  *N.B.* you will have to change the directory
   **SQL_Analysis** Answers some basic data questions

## Python - QV Webscrape
While I've used python to make small games in the past, I've mostly used it for scraping data.
I've often found it a great way to make a quick data-set when required. 
  **QV Scrape** shows how easy it is to scape data from websites. I choose to pull in QV data as it's a great example of how to cycle through pages, grabbing data.
