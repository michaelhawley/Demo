# Demo of SQL, R, & Python 
Here's a demo of some basic scripts written during lockdown.
I'll continue to add to this. 

##SQL - COVID19
I've only used basic SQL; mostly to *'bridge the gap'* within other applications or as SQLite within python. 
*Lockdown 2020* is a great time to transfer that knowledge to **PostgreSQL** and consolidate that knowledge. 

**SQL_PrepareData** Pulls in data and transforms it
  *N.B.* you will have to change the directory
   **QL_Analysis** Answers some basic data questions

##Python - QV Webscrape
While I've used python to make small game in the past, I mostly use it for scraping data.
  **QV Scrape** shows how easy it is to scape data from websites. 
  Here I've used the QV site to pull in recent data on New Zealand's obsession - 'the housing market'
