# Demo of SQL, R, & Python 
I making this demo during the great 2020 lockdown. My partner and I recently left our jobs with the intention of doing a US Roadtrip.  COVID19 put a stop to that! 
Who needs a holiday when you can practice programming? So far I have three small demos that will hopefully show I have some some (limited) ability to write code for the purposes of analysis. 


## R - COVID19
After using R extensively during University, I've only used it sparely since. 
Generally most things are simple enough to be well understood in Excel. Excel is easy to share & easy to explain. 

Some projects require some more robust analysis and visualisation. Here I'm taking some free COVID19 datasets and begining to put some graphs to them
This is still very much a work in progress as I play around with different graphs.

## Python - QV Webscrape
While I've used python to make small games in the past, I've mostly used it for scraping data.
I've often found it a great way to make a quick data-set when required. 
  **QV Scrape** shows how easy it is to scape data from websites. I choose to pull in QV data as it's a great example of how to cycle through pages, grabbing data. 
  

## SQL - COVID19

**SQL_PrepareData** Pulls in data and transforms it
  *N.B.* you will have to change the directory
   **SQL_Analysis** Answers some basic data questions
