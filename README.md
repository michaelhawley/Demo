# Demo of SQL, R, & Python 
Here's a demo of some basic scripts written during lockdown.
I'll continue to add to this. 

##SQL - COVID19
### Basic
I've only used basic SQL; mostly to * *'bridge the gap'* * within other applications or as SQLite within python. 
* *Lockdown 2020* * is a great time to transfer that knowledge to **PostgreSQL** and consolidate that knowledge. 

** SQL_PrepareData ** Pulls in data and transforms it
* *N.B. * * you will have to change the directory
** SQL_Analysis ** Answers some basic data questions
