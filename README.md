# Demonstration material

This is a quick demonstration of some simple tools I use in my work.
I'm making this demo while between jobs during lockdown. 

Here I'm demonstrating 5 keys skills.
- Slide Decks / Business Cases
- R 
- Excel
- Python
- SQL

## Business Cases

I've done a lot of modelling in Excel and a lot of business case slide decks, unfortunately they nearly all contain senstive information or strategy type infomation that can't be shared. 

Instead I've chosen an insights pack delivered to the Sales team of American Airlines post the announcement of Auckland-Dallas. The target audience is the Sales team with the more numbers orientated Network Planning team not attending.

While it's not the complete pack, the chosen slides are a good example of the type of packs I make. These slides contain no information that isn't freely available from StatsNZ or other sources. 

## R - COVID19

After using R extensively during University, I've used it sparely since. 
Generally I prefer to use Excel. Where possible models should be kept as simple as possible. Excel is easy to share and explain.  

Some projects require some more robust analysis and visualisation. Here I'm taking some free COVID19 datasets and begining to put some graphs to them
This is still very much a work in progress as I play around with different graphs. 

## Excel Bank Structures

While I love Pivot tables and Index Matches etc. I'd rather show you something that a lot of Excel Wizards don't know. 
Adding text as a measure to a pivot table!

Here I'm using it to make a bank structure diagram to add to slide packs. A bank structure shows the waves of flying in and out of an airport with the top being Arriving flights and the bottom being departing flights.
The data is added in the next sheet, pivoted, and then the text added as a measure. The cells are then formatted with conditional formatting looked up from the table below. 

Here is the same sheet making a bank structure for Dubai

## Python - QV Webscrape
https://github.com/michaelhawley/Demo/tree/master/Python
While I've used python to make small games in the past, I've mostly used it for scraping data. Sometimes a paid data source is too expensive or not available. 
Here I've chose to pull data from the QV website as it's a perfect example of how to use the Selenium package.

## SQL - COVID19
https://github.com/michaelhawley/Demo/tree/master/SQL
I haven't had to use SQL extensively, only to bridge the gap. I've used within the context of other tools and within Python as SQLite to handle some very very large datasets (20gb+)
Here I'm demonstrating that I have the basics down, but not enough to be a full time SQL developer. 

**SQL_PrepareData** Pulls in data and transforms it 

*N.B.* you will have to change the directory
**SQL_Analysis** Answers some basic data questions
